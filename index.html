                    <p>I bought this domain on a whim, without any concrete plans. After much contemplation, I made an unconventional choice â€“ the decision to not decide. Instead, I entrusted my friends with the power to choose.</p>
                    <p>And so, the Button Game was born. Drawing strong inspiration from a Minecraft YouTube series, which itself took cues from a Reddit post.</p>
                    <p>The victor of this game gains the privilege to showcase whatever they desire on this very website.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>The rules of the game are refreshingly simple: Keep the button alive throughout the designated time frame, which, in this case, is set at one month.</li>
                      <li>To safeguard the button's existence, all you need to do is post `!save` in our GroupMe chat. This action will reset the countdown clock, and your score will be based on the button's proximity to the bottom. Lower scores indicate better performance.</li>
                      <li>It's important to note that your previous score will always be replaced. For example, if you previously saved the button while it was in the "green zone", but you send a `!save` when it's in the "blue zone", your score will now correspond to the "blue zone".</li>
                      <li>The current state of the button will only be revealed upon checking. The game won't send status alerts to the chat. Furthermore, unless fellow players choose to disclose their actions, you won't be aware of the levels at which others have saved the button.</li>
                      <li>Lastly, and perhaps most crucially, if the button ceases to exist, it's a collective loss for everyone.</li>
